Is it technically interesting?\
My games uses the function .setDepth to modify the depth of certain sprites. I experimented with this when creating obstacles and collectable items and would varry the depth depending on which row these items spawned on. I am particularyly proud of this because I had to learn how to implement this by reading the Phaser documentation. I also implemented a universal game speed that increases to increase difficulty after a certain amount of time in the game. I experimented with ways to implement this and settled with an event listener that calls a function to increase the speed of the game.

Does it have visual style?\
I am particularly proud of the art in this game. I drew all assets and animated the sprites with Procreate. Instead of created pixel art assets, I opted for a cartoon, soft style that matches the "dreamy" music I paired with the game. I also made background tiles with parallax scrolling that I am very proud of since I made these tiles seem "infinite" by connecting the ends of my drawings together.
